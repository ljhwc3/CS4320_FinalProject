# CS4320_FinalProject
this directory contains the final code for our project (although it is still in a working progress).
How this application works (for now):

to login try entering the following information:
username: luke
password: aaaaaa (a six times).
You would notice you will go to a page that is our hello page which it will try to pull up your username and real name information. However, since things are assigned in this application statically (not dynamically), we felt safer as a team to not show the username nor real name for this user since this user is a demo. You will notice below the screen two buttons, one for creating a profile and the other for login out. Try clicking on the create profile button. this new page, profile page, you will notice two new buttons one is about and the other one is create profile. Hit the about button first and you will see a box that shows where your information should be entered in order to create a profile. After you enter the information, you should hit the profile page (this page will display some code since it is still in the working process  still not a complete view). Try going back now by the back arrow on your browser to return to the previous page. Now you would notice a link that says “Back to User Homepage.” You are now back to the login page. From here we would like to go to the registration page; and to do so you would notice a link below “register new account”. This page correctly registers users into the database and corrects the email and checks the password twice. After registration one should be able to login into the account.

To install:
download the code and hit and type in the link where that directory exsists. It will aoutomatically take you to register php since it was named as index.php.
